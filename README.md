## Let's Revise Microsoft Azure Cloud

### 1. Compute Services
(Azure compute services are the hosting services responsible for hosting and running the application workloads. )
- <b>Azure Virtual Machines</b> - Windows or Linux virtual machines (VMs) hosted in Azure.
- <b>Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets</b> - Scaling for Windows or Linux VMs hosted in Azure.
- <b>Azure Kubernetes Service</b> - Cluster management for VMs that run containerized services.
- <b>Azure Service Fabric</b> - Distributed systems platform that runs in Azure or on-premises.
- <b>Azure Batch</b> - Managed service for parallel and high-performance computing applications.
- <b>Azure Container Instances</b> - Containerized apps run on Azure without provisioning servers or VMs.
- <b>Azure Functions</b> - An event-driven, serverless compute service.
### 2. Storage Services
(Azure provides four main types of storage services.)
- <b>Azure Blob storage</b> - Storage service for very large objects, such as video files or bitmaps.
- <b>Azure File storage</b> - File shares that can be accessed and managed like a file server.
- <b>Azure Queue storage</b> - A data store for queuing and reliably delivering messages between applications.
- <b>Azure Table storage</b> - Table storage is a service that stores non-relational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design.

All these services have some common characteristics. They are :

  Durable and highly available with redundancy and replication.
  Secure through automatic encryption and role-based access control.
  Scalable with virtually unlimited storage.
  Managed, handling maintenance and any critical problems for you.
  Accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.


### 3. Networking Services
(Linking compute resources and providing access to applications is the key function of Azure networking. Networking functionality in Azure includes a range of options to connect the outside world to services and features in the global Azure datacenters.)
- <b>Azure Virtual Network</b> - Connects VMs to incoming virtual private network (VPN) connections.
- <b>Azure Load Balancer</b> - Balances inbound and outbound connections to applications or service endpoints.
- <b>Azure Application Gateway</b> - Optimizes app server farm delivery while increasing application security.
- <b>Azure VPN Gateway</b> - Accesses Azure Virtual Networks through high-performance VPN gateways.
- <b>Azure DNS</b> - Provides ultra-fast DNS responses and ultra-high domain availability.
- <b>Azure Content Delivery Network</b> - Delivers high-bandwidth content to customers globally.
- <b>Azure DDoS Protection</b> - Protects Azure-hosted applications from distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.
